      <h1>Lentil Soup</h1>
      <h3>1 hour</h3>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <p>¼ cup extra virgin olive oil</p>
      <p>1 medium yellow or white onion, chopped</p>
      <p>2 carrots, peeled and chopped</p>
      <p>4 garlic cloves, pressed or minced</p>
      <p>2 teaspoons ground cumin</p>
      <p>1 teaspoon curry powder</p>
      <p>½ teaspoon dried thyme</p>
      <p>1 large can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes, lightly drained</p>
      <p>1 cup brown or green lentils, picked over and rinsed</p>
      <p>4 cups vegetable broth</p>
      <p>2 cups water</p>
      <p>1 teaspoon salt, more to taste</p>
      <p>Pinch of red pepper flakes</p>
      <p>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</p>
      <p>1 cup chopped fresh collard greens or kale, tough ribs removed</p>
      <p>1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice (½ to 1 medium lemon), to taste</p>
    </div>

    <br />
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
      1. Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat.
      One-fourth cup olive oil may seem like a lot, but it adds a lovely
      richness and heartiness to this nutritious soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook,
      stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent,
      about 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Add the garlic, cumin, curry powder and thyme. Cook until fragrant
      while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained diced
      tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring often, in order to
      enhance their flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Pour in the lentils, broth and the water. Add 1 teaspoon salt and a
      pinch of red pepper flakes. Season generously with freshly ground black
      pepper. Raise heat and bring the mixture to a boil, then partially cover
      the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 25 to 30
      minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Transfer 2 cups of the soup to a blender. Securely fasten the lid,
      protect your hand from steam with a tea towel placed over the lid, and
      purée the soup until smooth. Pour the puréed soup back into the pot. (Or,
      use an immersion blender to blend a portion of the soup.)
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Add the chopped greens and cook for 5 more minutes, or until the greens
      have softened to your liking. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in 1
      tablespoon of lemon juice. Taste and season with more salt, pepper and/or
      lemon juice until the flavors really sing. For spicier soup, add another
      pinch or two of red pepper flakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Serve while hot. Leftovers will keep well for about 4 days in the
      refrigerator, or can be frozen for several months (just defrost before
      serving).
